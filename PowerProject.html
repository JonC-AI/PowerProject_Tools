		<h2>Overview</h2>
		
		<p>The <strong>PowerProject Tool</strong> company is known for its variety of cordless power tools, ranging anywhere from <em>standard power drills and circular saws to lawn and gardening tools</em>. The <strong><em>KLE550 Series of Tools</em></strong> adds a new line of tools to the company’s well-known reputation for <ins>quality and affordable power tools</ins>. </p>
	
		<p>The <strong><em>KLE550 Series</em></strong> includes a new <em>45V lithium ion-powered leaf blower, lawn mower, pole saw, hedge trimmer, weed eater, chainsaw, and mulcher</em>. 45V lithium ion batteries are new to the industry and could <strong>revolutionize</strong> the battery life and mobility of traditional gas-powered and electric tools.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong><em>KLE550 Series Tool</em></strong>, 45V lithium ion batteries, currently work with the <strong><em>KLE550 Series</em></strong> <ins>ONLY</ins>. This means that the batteries aren't interchangeable with <strong>PowerProject</strong>'s standard line of battery-operated tools. <em>Additional battery packs and charging stations are available for purchase through the <strong>KLE550 Series</strong>.</em></p>

		<h2>Features</h2>
		
		<ul>
			<li><strong>4–8 hours of battery life:</strong> Depending on the tool in the series, the 45V battery yields 4 to 8 hours of continuous use.</li>

			<li><strong>Powerful motors:</strong> The motors in the KLE550 series are comparable to corded electric counterparts in the company’s corded power tool series.</li>
			
			<li><strong>Safety:</strong> All KLE550-series power tools come with a safety switch that prevents the tool from turning on once the battery is installed. This feature saves battery life and protects the user</li>
			
			<li><strong>Warranty:</strong> Each tool in the KLE550 series comes with a one-year warranty and an extended warranty option</li>
